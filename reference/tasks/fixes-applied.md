# Fixes Applied - Quote Button Feature

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Button Layout Incorrect ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Quote button was positioned with the "Add to Cart" button instead of the "Buy Now" payment button.

**Solution:**
- Modified [snippets/buy-buttons.liquid](snippets/buy-buttons.liquid)
- Created two separate rows:
  - **Row 1:** Quantity selector + Add to Cart button (original layout preserved)
  - **Row 2:** Quote button (50%) + Buy Now payment button (50%)
- Quote button only appears alongside Buy Now button if dynamic checkout is enabled
- If no Buy Now button, quote button shows full width

**Changes Made:**
- Lines 293-379 in `buy-buttons.liquid`
- First row keeps quantity and "Add to Cart" together
- Second row (`.product-form__action-buttons`) contains quote + payment buttons at 50% width each

**Result:**
- ✅ Quantity and "Add to Cart" stay together (unchanged from original)
- ✅ Quote button and "Buy Now" button are together at 50% width each
- ✅ Proper spacing between rows (`mt-4` margin)

---

### Issue #2: Success Message Showing by Default ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Success message was displaying by default due to Shopify's `form.posted_successfully?` check, but it should only show AFTER successful AJAX submission to email.

**Solution:**
- Removed the Shopify form success check from [snippets/quote-modal.liquid](snippets/quote-modal.liquid)
- Success message now ONLY shows via JavaScript after confirmed email send
- The JavaScript in `quote-modal.js` handles showing success after AJAX response

**Changes Made:**
- Lines 32-37 in `quote-modal.liquid`
- Removed the `{%- if form.posted_successfully? -%}` block
- Success message container (`data-quote-success-container`) remains and is controlled by JavaScript only

**JavaScript Flow:**
1. Form submits via AJAX (line 285 in quote-modal.js)
2. Wait for response from Shopify contact form endpoint
3. If `response.ok` → show success message (line 308)
4. Success message displays for 5 seconds
5. Modal auto-closes

**Result:**
- ✅ Success message ONLY shows after successful email submission
- ✅ 5-second display timer starts AFTER successful send
- ✅ No premature success message display

## Behavior Summary

## Notes

- If a store has "Buy Now" payment buttons disabled in their Shopify settings, the quote button will display full width below the Add to Cart button
- The payment button (Buy Now) is Shopify's dynamic checkout button - it appears when `show_dynamic_checkout` is true
- All existing functionality of quantity selector and Add to Cart remains unchanged
- The fixes maintain backward compatibility with the existing theme structure

---

## Deployment

The fixes are ready to deploy. Simply push the updated files:

```bash
shopify theme push
```

Or manually upload these three files via Shopify Admin:
1. `snippets/buy-buttons.liquid`
2. `snippets/quote-modal.liquid`
