# Final Implementation Status - Quote Button Feature

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

### Issue #1: Button Layout - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Quote button was with "Add to Cart" instead of "Buy Now" button.

**Solution:**
```
Row 1: [Quantity] [Add to Cart]       ← Original, unchanged
Row 2: [Quote Button 50%] [Buy Now 50%]  ← New, quote with payment button
```

**Files Changed:**
- `snippets/buy-buttons.liquid` (lines 293-379)
- `assets/quote-modal.css` (lines 290-341)

---

### Issue #2: Success Message Premature Display - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Success message showing by default or before email sends.

**Solution:**
- Removed Shopify's `form.posted_successfully?` check
- Success container has `hidden` attribute by default (line 120)
- JavaScript `showSuccess()` only called AFTER successful AJAX response
- Success displays for 5 seconds ONLY after confirmed email send

**How It Works:**
1. Modal opens → Form visible, Success hidden
2. User submits → AJAX request to Shopify contact form
3. Wait for response
4. **IF** response.ok → Hide form, Show success
5. Auto-close after 5 seconds
6. On close → Reset: Show form, Hide success

**Files Changed:**
- `snippets/quote-modal.liquid` (removed lines 33-37)
- `assets/quote-modal.js` (lines 310-328 handle success display)

```

      → Show error alert
```

### Showing Success:
