## How It Works

### 1. User Flow
1. User views product page
2. Sees "Begär offert" and "Add to Cart" buttons side by side (50% width each)
3. Clicks "Begär offert" button
4. Modal opens with product name pre-filled
5. User enters phone and email
6. User checks GDPR consent checkbox
7. Clicks "Jag vill bli kontaktad" button
8. Form submits via AJAX
9. Success message displays for 5 seconds
10. Modal auto-closes

### 2. Email Flow
- Form data submitted to Shopify's native contact form endpoint
- Shopify sends email notification to store's customer notification email
- Email contains all product details and customer contact information

### 3. Technical Flow
```
Quote Button Click
  → Open Modal (quote-modal.js)
  → Pre-fill Product Name
  → User Fills Form
  → Validate Form Fields
  → Submit via Shopify Contact Form (AJAX)
  → Show Success Message
  → Auto-close after 5 seconds
  → Reset Form
```

## Configuration Required

### 1. Email Setup (Important!)
To receive quote requests at **info@totallager.se**, you need to configure Shopify notifications:

**Option A: Change Customer Notification Email**
1. Go to Shopify Admin
2. Settings → Notifications
3. Find "Customer contact form" notification
4. Ensure it's enabled
5. The emails will go to your store's primary email
6. Set up email forwarding from your store email to info@totallager.se

**Option B: Shopify Email Settings**
1. Go to Shopify Admin
2. Settings → Store details
3. Set "Store contact email" to info@totallager.se
4. All contact form submissions will go there

**Option C: Email Forwarding Rule**
- Set up forwarding in your current email provider
- Forward all emails with subject "Förfrågan om offert" to info@totallager.se

### 2. Privacy Policy Link
The GDPR checkbox includes a link to `/pages/privacy-policy`. Make sure you have a privacy policy page at this URL, or update the link in [snippets/quote-modal.liquid](snippets/quote-modal.liquid) line 66.

### 3. Test the Feature
Before going live, test the quote form:
1. Visit any product page
2. Click "Begär offert"
3. Fill out the form with test data
4. Check that email arrives at the configured email address
5. Verify all product details are included in the email
