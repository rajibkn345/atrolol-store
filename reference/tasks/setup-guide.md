## Performance Tips

1. **Preload CSS (if needed)**

   ```liquid
   {{ 'quote-modal.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag: preload: true }}
   ```

2. **Minify Files**
   - Minify CSS and JS before uploading
   - Reduces file size and improves load time

3. **Test Page Speed**
   - Use Google PageSpeed Insights
   - Check that modal doesn't impact page load time
   - Files are loaded deferred, so no blocking
